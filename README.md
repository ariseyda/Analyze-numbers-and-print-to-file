# Analyze-numbers-and-print-to-file
Write C source code for a computer program that receives an unsigned integer from user and decomposes it to its digits and stores the digits in an array. If the entered value has n digits, the digits array should have n elements. The 0th element of the digits array should be the units digit of the entered value. The 1st element of the digits array should be the tens digit of the entered value an so on. After decomposition, save the number and its digits to a text file and print the digits array like example console output given below. Receiving integers should continue until zeros is being entered and each result should be added to the text file.  Enter an unsigned integer: 123456 123456 = 1x10^5 + 2x10^4 + 3x10^3 + 4x10^2 + 5x10^1 + 6x10^0
